GemAuction
==========

Basic nodejs and express application, still prototyping and hacking away :P

Pull the repository down and run the command "npm install" from the project root
  - this will install all the necessary dependencies outlined in packages.json
You will need to download and install the following packages:
  1. mongodb
  2. redis
